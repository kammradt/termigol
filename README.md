## Description üìù  
  
I really enjoy learning new stuff, and the easiest path for me is by doing a project.    
I was curious about [Golang](https://golang.org/) and how to use it, so I decided to create a simple terminal emulator.    
> This project does not want in any way be a product, the-best-solution nor compete with any other similar project, this is just a the result of a learning process :stuck_out_tongue:  
  
  
## Goals üó∫Ô∏è   
  
<details><summary>Commands</summary>
  
<p>

  * [x] ls
  * [x] exit
  * [ ] help
  * [ ] cat
  * [ ] pwd
  * [ ] echo
  * [ ] ping
  * [ ] date
  * [ ] mv
  * [ ] cp

</p>

</details>

<details><summary>Structure</summary>
  
<p>

* [ ]  Have beautiful output colors  
* [ ]  Be able to handle options such `ls -l`  

* Handle commands as just string is not a really good ideia. Maybe we can create a custom `struct` that will handle the command, options, flags, content, etc.  
  
* Being able to perform commands such as `cat file.txt | grep "text"` or `cp file.txt file-bkp.txt && echo "done"`  
  
* Create a graphical interface

</p>
