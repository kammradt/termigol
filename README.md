## Description 📝

I really enjoy learning new stuff, and the easiest path for me is by doing a project.  
I was curious about [Golang](https://golang.org/) and how to use it, so I decided to create a simple terminal emulator.  
> This project does not want in any way be a product, the-best-solution nor compete with any other similar project, this is just a the result of a learning process :stuck_out_tongue:


## Goals 🗺️ 

<details>
  <summary>1.0 - First steps</summary>
  <p>Be able to use these commands: ls, cat, pwd, echo</p>
  <p>Have beautiful output colors</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2.0 - More commands</summary>
  <p>Be able to use these commands: ping, date, mv, cp</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3.0 - Flags</summary>
  <p>Be able to handle options such: </p>
  <p>`ls -l`</p>
  <p>`someCommand --verbose`</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>4.0 - Command structure</summary>
  <p>Handle commands as just string is not a really good ideia. Maybe we can create a custom `struct` that will handle the command, options, flags, content, etc.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>5.0 - Control and redirection</summary>
  <p>Being able to perform commands such as `cat file.txt | grep "text"` or `cp file.txt file-bkp.txt && echo "done"`>
</details>
