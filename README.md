## Description üìù

I really enjoy learning new stuff, and the easiest path for me is by doing a project.  
I was curious about [Golang](https://golang.org/) and how to use it, so I decided to create a simple terminal emulator.  
> This project does not want in any way be a product, the-best-solution nor compete with any other similar project, this is just a the result of a learning process :stuck_out_tongue:


## Goals üó∫Ô∏è 


<details><summary>1.0 - First steps</summary>

* [ ]  Be able to use these commands: ls, cat, pwd, echo
* [ ]  Have beautiful output colors

</details><details><summary>2.0 - More commands</summary>

* [ ]  Be able to use these commands: ping, date, mv, cp

</details><details><summary>3.0 - Flags</summary>

Be able to handle options such:
*  [ ]  `ls -l`
*  [ ] `someCommand --verbose`

</details><details><summary>4.0 - Command structure</summary>

*   Handle commands as just string is not a really good ideia. Maybe we can create a custom `struct` that will handle the command, options, flags, content, etc.

</details><details><summary>5.0 - Control and redirection</summary>

*   Being able to perform commands such as `cat file.txt | grep "text"` or `cp file.txt file-bkp.txt && echo "done"`

</details><details><summary>X.0 - Graphic interface</summary>

*   I do not have any ideia how to do this
