> A bad terminal-kinda project written in Go



## Description 📝

I really enjoy learning new stuff, and the easiest path for me is by doing a project.  
I was curious about [Golang](https://golang.org/) and how to use it, so I decided to create a simple terminal emulator.  
> This project does not want in any way be a product, the-best-solution nor compete with any other similar project, this is just a the result of a learning process :stuck_out_tongue:

## How to use :pencil2:

```go run termigol.go```
